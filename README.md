# Pomona College Math Thesis
This is the Math Thesis submitted to Pomona College in partial fulfillment of the Degree of Bachelor of Arts by Alan Peral, under the supervision of Dr. Shahriar Shahriari. 

## File Structure

The folders contained within contain the necessary components of my thesis. The tex folder contains my thesis at several iterations of its journey, numbered accordingly. 
The first folder contains a test bibliography, made just to make sure everything was up and running smoothly. It is not of much interest.
The second folder contains a brief thesis outline, the 2.5 folder contains a very brief presentation, and the third folder contains a short draft of the first chapter. The fourth folder might be of some interest, as it contains the final pdf of my presentation slides, and the fifth folder contains a complete draft of my thesis. There is also an unnumbered folder that just contains notes I made as I completed this process. 

The Resources folder, predictably, contains textbooks and papers that I looked at as I gave shape to my thesis topic.

The python folder contains the program I used to solve simplified models as presented in my thesis and final presentation. For more information on the code please refer to the last section in my thesis. Running the toy_solver.py file on the command line will prompt you to enter all the necessary information to run an instance of the program. Uncommenting the code at the end of the toy_solver.py file will run a pre-formulated instance of the problem.

The final draft of my thesis is also presented, and accordingly named.
